# Feedie

Feedie is a feed reader for Ubuntu 9.10.

It is simple and to the point.

It is not slow and it does not crash (unlike most other feed readers I have
tried).

It does not track your reading habits and let Eric Schmidt spy on you (unlike
Google Reader).

Maybe you will like it.

Head on over to <https://launchpad.net/~kr/+archive/ppa> if you just want to
use it.
